# ðŸ‘— What is this Application?

This is not your usual AI virtual try-on.
Our assistant goes beyond simple outfit visualization â€” it actually understands your personal wardrobe better than you.

## âœ¨ Why use it?

No more wasting time mixing and matching outfits every morning.

Get personalized outfit suggestions directly from your own wardrobe.

## ðŸ”‘ How it works

Upload your wardrobe â€“ Just take raw pictures of your clothes (tops, shirts, dresses, skirts, etc.) using any basic camera.
Choose your options â€“ Select a top and bottom (or any clothing combination) you might wear today.
AI Outfit Combos â€“ The assistant will generate unique outfit combinations, including some you may have never thought of.
Style with Accessories â€“ Love a combo? You can even try it with your own accessories to see how the look elevates.

## ðŸŽ¯ What makes this different?

Unlike traditional virtual try-on tools, this appâ€™s main focus is your real wardrobe. It helps you make the most of what you already own, while sparking new styling ideas.
